## Introduction

This project analyzes a large dataset of Google Play Store applications to uncover trends and insights related to app performance and popularity. Using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy, this project cleans the dataset, handles missing data, and visualizes key attributes to understand app dynamics.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains over 10,000 apps with information on:

- App Name  
- Category  
- Rating  
- Reviews  
- Size  
- Installs  
- Price  
- Content Rating  
- Last Updated  
- Android Version and more

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Normalizing app size and version fields  
- Filtering duplicates and invalid entries

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This phase explores:

- Distribution of app ratings and reviews  
- Trends across categories and content ratings  
- Correlations between installs and ratings

## Visualizations and Insights

Numerous plots such as boxplots, histograms, and bar charts reveal interesting insights, including:

- Most popular app categories  
- Rating distributions and outliers  
- Install count variation across categories

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.  
2. Install required Python packages: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`.  
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`visualizationhandson.ipynb`) in your environment.  
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Dependencies and Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- numpy

## Contribution and Support

Suggestions, bug reports, and pull requests are welcome. Please open issues or submit pull requests to contribute.
